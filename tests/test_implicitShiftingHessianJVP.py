"""Phase 4 step 3 of `warpSPHCore/warpier_forward_mode_plan.md`: "`Hess C . v`
is a JVP of that JVP" -- validated against `wp_implicitShifting.py`'s own `H`
output, the same way `test_implicitShiftingGradientJVP.py` validated step 2's
`grad C` against its `J` output.

`implicitShifting.py`'s Newton solve needs `Hess(C) @ x` (the BiCGStab
matvec, `implicitShifting._multiplyLaplacianBlock`): `out_i = diagBlock_i @
x_i - sum_{j in N(i)} H_ij @ x_j`, `diagBlock_i = sum_{j != i} omega_j H_ij`,
built from `wp_implicitShifting.computeShiftingPairTerms`'s hand-rolled
per-pair `sphKernelHessian` call plus a hand-written `torch.einsum`/
`scatter_sum` assembly -- no autograd involved, and (per the module's own
docstring, corrected during this same Phase 4 step 3) self-pairs are dropped
before assembly as an *exact* translation-invariance identity (the self
term's true contribution to `d^2 C_i/dx_i^2` is zero for any finite pairwise
kernel Hessian -- `sphKernelHessian` is itself well-defined and finite at
`r=0`, not unstable there; an earlier version of that docstring claimed
otherwise and was wrong), and the off-diagonal block is `-omega_k H_ik`, not
the naively-placed `omega_j H_ij` (the same identity, one sign away --
needed for the assembled operator to come out symmetric).

`warpSPHCore.warpOperationHVP` (Phase 4 step 3,
`coreOperations.wp_densityHVP.computeSPHDensityPositionHVP`) reduces to
exactly `sum_{j != i} m_j * H_ij @ (v_i - v_j)` -- the same closed form as
`_multiplyLaplacianBlock(diagBlock, Hw, v, ...)` once expanded algebraically
-- but was derived by differentiating `warpOperationJVP`'s own position
tangent a second time ("a JVP of that JVP"), then reusing
`kernels.hessian.sphKernelHessian` (the same building block
`computeShiftingPairTerms` calls) through `warpOperationHVP`'s own
adjacency/self-pair handling, not by transcribing `_multiplyLaplacianBlock`.
Agreement here is therefore evidence the composed-JVP route reaches the same
operator, not a tautology. (Whether the composed-JVP route needs the
self-pair drop *at all* turns out to depend on how it's called: for this
test's own `tangentQueryPositions == tangentReferencePositions` usage --
the same particle moving in both roles -- dropping is a bitwise no-op, since
the self term's `(v_i - v_i) = 0` factor already annihilates it; see
`warpSPHCore/tests/operations/test_forward_mode_tier2_density_hvp_self_pair.py`
for that check made explicit, and `wp_densityHVP.py`'s own docstring for why
it's still required for the *asymmetric* tangent construction
`implicitShiftingAutomatic.py` uses to isolate `diagBlock`.)
