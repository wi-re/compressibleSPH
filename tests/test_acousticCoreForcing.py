"""`JFNK_PLAN.md` Phase E1: the Kolmogorov-flow-style forcing term added to
the rudimentary acoustic core (`AcousticCoreConfig.forcingAmplitude`/
`forcingWavenumber`, `f_acoustic_core`'s optional `dv_x/dt += forcingAmplitude
* sin(forcingWavenumber * pi * y)` term).

**The finding, recorded here** (this module's own docstring is the "record
it either way" step, mirroring `test_acousticCoreStability.py`'s Phase B
writeup): unlike Phase B's periodic vortex -- a smooth rotational flow with
no instability mechanism, where a well-converged JFNK solve stayed bounded
indefinitely at 20x the acoustic CFL with zero dissipation -- the Kolmogorov
base flow `v_x = xi*sin(k*pi*y)` is a textbook example of a *linearly
unstable* shear flow (the Meshalkin-Sinai/Kolmogorov-flow instability).
With zero dissipation, nothing damps the exponentially growing perturbation
mode, so **every** solver tested here eventually diverges once that mode
reaches nonlinear/numerical blow-up -- confirmed empirically, and confirmed
*not* to be an artifact of the fixed acoustic-CFL-scaled `dt` becoming
advectively invalid as the flow accelerates (a velocity-tracking adaptive
`dt` was tried and diverged at essentially the same step count). `JFNKSolver`
does not prevent this, but it measurably delays it relative to the other two
solvers at the same `dt` -- `RK4` and `FixedPointSolver` (Picard(2), the
registry default) both diverge by step 5-6, `JFNKSolver` by step ~13,
consistent across repeated runs (unlike Phase B's Picard(2) comparison,
this timing is *not* GPU-reduction-order-flaky, confirmed by 3 repeats
landing on the exact same step each time). This is a genuinely different
answer from Phase B's, and it is the expected one: real `cases/kolmogorov.py`
both seeds symmetry-breaking noise deliberately (to trigger transition on
purpose) and relies on δ-SPH's artificial/physical viscosity to keep the
resulting turbulent cascade numerically bounded -- dissipation here is
physically load-bearing against a real hydrodynamic instability, a different
concern from the acoustic-stiffness problem JFNK actually solves. The two
findings are complementary, not contradictory: JFNK's payoff is real and
substantial (removing the acoustic `dt` tax), but it is not a general
substitute for dissipation on every flow -- only on ones (like Phase B's
vortex) with no other instability mechanism at zero dissipation.
