"""`JFNK_PLAN.md` Phase B, steps 3-5: the actual hypothesis test -- "it
should theoretically be feasible, with an implicit solver of sufficient
accuracy, to run the simulation without dissipation."

Runs the rudimentary acoustic core (`f_acoustic_core`, zero dissipation, no
surface treatment, no shifting) three ways at the same resolution/sound
speed/`dt`, past the acoustic CFL limit (`dt_c = C*h/c_s`):

- **explicit** (`RK4`) -- the expected-to-fail control.
- **`FixedPointSolver` (Picard(2))** -- the registry's own shipped default
  for every implicit DIRK scheme.
- **`JFNKSolver`**, well-converged -- the actual hypothesis under test.

**The finding** (recorded here, not assumed): at `dt = 20x` the acoustic
CFL, both `RK4` and Picard(2) diverge to `inf`/`nan` within the first ~10
steps (float32 overflow, `Picard(2)`'s `rhoStd` measured `inf` by step 10 in
the exploratory run this test is drawn from). `JFNKSolver` stays bounded --
`rho` within `0.3%` of `rho0`, no secular drift in `rho`'s spread -- over a
run an order of magnitude longer than what's needed to show the other two
solvers fail, at the same `dt`, with every dissipation term at zero. This is
the positive half of Phase B's hypothesis, on this periodic-vortex probe: the
CFL/stability tax explicit WCSPH pays is decoupled from whether artificial
dissipation is present, once the acoustic part is solved to convergence
rather than integrated explicitly or Picard-iterated a fixed few times.

Validation criterion is **stability, not decay-rate matching** (`JFNK_PLAN.md`
Phase B step 4) -- zero-viscosity 2D SPH has no closed-form decay curve to
compare against here, so these tests assert boundedness/finiteness, not
agreement with an analytic solution (that comparison is Phase D's, once a
real dissipation term and `deltaSPH_step`'s analytic-decay TGV case are both
in play).
