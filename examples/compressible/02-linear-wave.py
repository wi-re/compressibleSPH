"""02 linear wave -- thin wrapper around the shared runner.

The notebook this came from is `02-Linear_Wave.ipynb`; the case itself is
`warpSPH.cases.linearWave`, and everything generic (config, step loop, export,
plotting, ffmpeg) is `warpSPH.runner`. Equivalent invocations::

    python examples/compressible/02-linear-wave.py
    warpsph-run linearWave            # also honours --precision

#: What this example fixes relative to the case defaults; still overridable,
#: because these are prepended to the command line rather than appended.
#: `--plot` is on because an example is meant to be watched -- pass `--no-plot`
#: for a headless run, or `--no-show` to keep the frames without a window.
