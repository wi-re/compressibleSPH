"""Decaying random flow in a walled box (2D) -- thin wrapper around the runner.

The case itself is `warpSPH.cases.randomFlow`, and everything generic (config,
step loop, export, plotting, ffmpeg) is `warpSPH.runner`. Equivalent
invocations::

    python examples/weaklyCompressible/06-randomFlow/randomFlow_bounded.py
    warpsph-run randomFlow --bounded --nx 256      # also honours --precision

The other shipped point of this case is `randomFlow_periodic.py`: the same
divergence-free noise field, periodic on every side and with a rigid body in
it. Here the box has free-slip walls instead, so the decay includes whatever
the boundary contributes -- which is the comparison the pair exists for.

`--bounded` widens the simulated domain by `--band` particle layers and cuts the
walls out of the interior; the case supplies `band=5` when it is left at the
periodic default of 0, because a zero-width wall region samples no boundary
particles at all. `randomFlow_bounded.ipynb` documents every knob.
