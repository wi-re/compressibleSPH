"""10 moving obstacle -- thin wrapper around the shared runner.

The notebook this came from is `10-moving-obstacle.ipynb`; the case itself is
`warpSPH.cases.movingObstacle`, and everything generic (config, step loop, export,
plotting, ffmpeg) is `warpSPH.runner`. Equivalent invocations::

    python examples/weaklyCompressible/10-moving-obstacle.py
    warpsph-run movingObstacle            # also honours --precision
