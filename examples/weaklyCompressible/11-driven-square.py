"""11 driven square -- thin wrapper around the shared runner.

The notebook this came from is `11-driven-square.ipynb`; the case itself is
`warpSPH.cases.drivenSquare`, and everything generic (config, step loop,
export, plotting, ffmpeg) is `warpSPH.runner`. Equivalent invocations::

    python examples/weaklyCompressible/11-driven-square.py
    warpsph-run drivenSquare            # also honours --precision

A square rigid body translates sideways at `obstacleVelocity` through an
otherwise still, periodic box of fluid -- a towed body, not a fixed one in a
freestream (that's `13-openFlow.py`). `--obstacleShape` takes any key of
`SHAPE_PRESETS`; `--enableFreestream` layers a driven current under the
translation as a separate experiment, off by default.
