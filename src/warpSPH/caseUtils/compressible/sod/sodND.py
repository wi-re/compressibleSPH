"""Sod shock tube in 2D and 3D -- the 1D setup extruded, sampled at equal mass.

Geometry, per dimension:

* **x** repeats `sod.py`'s arrangement exactly. The domain is periodic on
  ``[-L/2, L/2]``, the left (dense) state occupies the middle half
  ``|x| <= L/4`` and the right state the two outer quarters, so there are two
  interfaces, at ``x = ±L/4``. Nothing is reflected explicitly: the mirror
  symmetry of that arrangement makes ``x = 0`` and ``x = ±L/2`` behave as
  reflecting walls for as long as the waves have not reached them, which is
  what makes a periodic box a usable shock tube. The analytic solution
  therefore describes the window ``x in [0, L/2]``, which is what
  `plotSodProfile` and `sodSolution.solve` are lined up against.
* **y (and z)** are plain periodic directions -- a slab, since the solution is
  uniform along them. Its width is given in *dense-side particle spacings*
  (`transverseSpacings`) rather than as a length, because the constraint it has
  to satisfy is a multiple of the particle spacing: a slab narrower than twice
  the largest support radius lets a particle interact with its own periodic
  image, silently. Fixing the width in spacings makes the transverse particle
  count independent of `nx` (so the count grows as `nx * spacings**(dim-1)`,
  linearly in resolution) and keeps that constraint satisfied at every
  resolution instead of only the one the default was picked at.
  `buildSodND` checks it against the supports it actually produced and raises
  rather than running a quietly wrong simulation.

Equal mass, not equal spacing
-----------------------------

The point of this sampler. Giving both states the same lattice would make the
dense side's particles four times heavier than the light side's (Sod's default
``rho_l/rho_r = 4``), and a 4:1 mass jump across the contact discontinuity is
exactly where SPH's density estimate misbehaves. So the light side is sampled
*coarser* instead, by ``(rho_l/rho_r)**(1/dim)`` in every direction, which
keeps ``mass = cell volume * density`` equal on both sides. That is the same
trade the 1D case already makes -- its ``samplingRatio=4`` default is
``rho_l/rho_r``, which is why 1D masses come out exactly equal -- and the same
one `sampleTriplePointEqualMass` makes in 2D with its ``sqrt(8)``.

"Coarser by ``ratio**(1/dim)``" is not generally an integer number of
particles, though, and both of the light side's counts have to be integers for
its lattice to close on the periodic box. In 3D it cannot be made exact at all:
``4**(1/3)`` is irrational, so no pair of commensurate periodic lattices has
exactly equal masses. What the sampler does instead is pick

1. the transverse count, from the isotropic ideal ``dx * ratio**(1/dim)``, and
2. the x count, to make ``mass = cell volume * density`` match the dense side
   as closely as one integer allows, given (1),

and then retry (1) one count either side, keeping whichever pair matches mass
best among those whose cells stay within `MAX_CELL_ASPECT` of cubic. That last
step is worth its five lines: at ``dim=3, nx=100`` it turns a 1.4% mass error
into 0.29%, and without the aspect bound it would happily take 0.04% at the
price of cells stretched by a third, which the (isotropic) kernel would feel
more than the mass jump it bought off.

Measured over ``nx`` from 25 to 400: exact in 1D and 2D at every resolution
whose counts divide evenly, otherwise within 4.2%; within 1.4% in 3D, with
cells never worse than 1.17:1. Both numbers are reported by
`sodSamplingReport` at build time and asserted in `tests/test_physics.py`.
Compare 75%, which is what equal *spacing* would give.

`buildSod1D` is deliberately left alone rather than being reimplemented on top
of this: it carries an explicit `samplingRatio` knob rather than deriving the
count, and the backprop notebook's recorded numbers are tied to its exact
output. This builder does handle ``dim=1``, where it agrees with `buildSod1D`
on spacings and masses but differs in one respect, on purpose: it lays the
light state out as a cell-centred lattice on the *periodic interval*
``[L/4, 3L/4]``, wrapped back into the box, instead of sampling a block
centred on the origin and pushing its two halves apart. Both give the same
mirror-symmetric arrangement, but the 1D path's ``pos[pos < 0] -= L/4`` /
``pos[pos > 0] += L/4`` leaves a particle sitting at ``x = 0`` -- in the middle
of the *dense* state, carrying the light state's mass -- whenever
``nx // samplingRatio`` is odd (``nx=100`` does it; the ``nx=800`` default does
not). `tests/test_physics.py` checks the agreement and this difference.
