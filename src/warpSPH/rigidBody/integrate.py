"""Explicit-Euler pose integrator for a `RigidBody`: advances orientation and
center of mass by its current angular/linear velocity, and would advance those
velocities by `dudt`/`dwdt` if a caller ever passed a nonzero value. Both call
sites (`systems/weaklyCompressible.py`, `systems/incompressible.py`) pass
`dudt=dwdt=0` every step, so in practice a rigid body's velocity is whatever a
case set once (e.g. `cases/movingObstacle.py`'s `angularVelocity`), not
something the fluid drives back.
