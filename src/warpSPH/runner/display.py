"""Live plot windows, and their teardown.

Separate from :mod:`warpSPH.cases.plotting` for one reason: the runner has to
tear a figure down at the end of a run, and the runner must not import from
`warpSPH.cases` -- it is generic over cases, not built on them. The case-facing
names are re-exported from `warpSPH.cases.plotting`, so a case still says
``from .plotting import openWindow``.

Why any of this is needed: a notebook frontend displays a figure for you, so
the notebooks these cases came from never had to. A console script does, and
without :func:`openWindow` it builds the figure, writes its PNGs, and shows
nothing at all.
