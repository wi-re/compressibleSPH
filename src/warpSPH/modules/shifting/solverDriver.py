"""Shared solve driver for the implicit shifting Newton step: picks the
primary Krylov solver (`ShiftingImplicitSolver`), runs it, and -- when
`ShiftProperties.implicitFallback` is set and the primary bails out (status
`< 0`) -- runs the fallback chain and returns the best iterate by stamped
true residual. Used by both `implicitShifting.computeImplicitShift` and
`implicitShiftingAutomatic.computeImplicitShiftAutomatic`, so the two stay in
lockstep.

The default (`implicitFallback == ShiftingImplicitFallback.none`) runs exactly
one solver and returns its result unconditionally -- byte-identical to the
pre-fallback behavior, so `ShiftingScheme.implicit` users see no change. The
fallback chain is opt-in:

  - `krylov`: on a primary bailout, retry with the *other* Krylov solver
    (BiCGStab<->GMRES) from a clean start `x0` and keep the better iterate
    (by stamped residual). This is the high-value fallback: the two solvers
    fail on different regimes -- e.g. the troubleshooting harness shows
    GMRES converging the near-breakdown cases where BiCGStab hits its rho
    guard.
  - `krylov_richardson`: `krylov`, plus a bounded Richardson polish
    (`richardson.richardsonSolve`) warm-started from the best Krylov iterate,
    as a last resort. Richardson is deliberately last: an eigenvalue probe
    shows it converges but is much slower than GMRES on the SPD
    `legacyPairwise` operator, and does not converge at all on the indefinite
    `exactHessian` operator (see `richardson.py`'s module docstring).

On any fallback activation a `warnings.warn` is emitted with the primary's
status and stamped residual, so a silently-bailed inner solve is no longer
invisible (the pre-fallback behavior used a bailed-out `xk` exactly as if it
had converged).
