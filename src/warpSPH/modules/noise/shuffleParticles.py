"""De-correlates a regular initial particle lattice by jittering fluid particles and relaxing them with repeated delta-SPH shifting steps.

Positions are first perturbed by Gaussian noise scaled by each particle's own
support (``jitterAmount`` fraction), then pushed through ``shiftIters``
rounds of ``computeDeltaShift`` (each shift scaled by a fixed factor of 10)
to spread out the resulting clumping/voids before the density field is used.
Only fluid particles (``kinds == 0``) are moved; boundary/ghost particles are
excluded from both the jitter and the shift update. Density is restored to
its pre-call value on return, and the original positions are restored on
``state`` -- the shuffled positions are returned as a fresh tensor rather
than mutating ``state`` in place. An earlier version of this function is left
commented out above the active one.
