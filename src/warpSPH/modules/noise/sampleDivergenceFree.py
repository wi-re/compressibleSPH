"""Builds a divergence-free 2D initial velocity field from a Perlin/Simplex noise potential (rotated gradient, `(dpsi/dy, -dpsi/dx)`), optionally SDF-ramped to zero at boundary regions.

The noise potential is generated once on a grid (``generateNoiseInterpolator``)
and interpolated onto particle positions by ``warpSPH.math.interpolation``'s
torch ``RegularGridInterpolator``, which keeps the field resident on the
querying device. It replaced scipy's host-only interpolator, whose
device -> host -> device round-trip per call dominated the per-step Kolmogorov
forcing in ``caseUtils/weaklyCompressible.py`` (~68% of host self-time at 155k
particles). Unlike scipy's, it is autograd-aware, so ``d(noise)/d(x)`` is a real
(piecewise-linear) gradient rather than an unconditional zero; the forcing call
site detaches its positions to keep its previous behaviour.
``generateRamp`` tapers the field to zero near boundary SDF regions
over a bandwidth set by ``schemeConfig.bandwith``, using a quintic smoothstep.
The resulting velocity is unit-normalized by its maximum magnitude and zeroed
on non-fluid (``kinds != 0``) particles.
