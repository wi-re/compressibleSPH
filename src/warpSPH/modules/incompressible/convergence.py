"""The relaxed-Jacobi solvers' stopping test, in one place.

Three loops iterate the same `A p = b` and each one used to spell its own
convergence test inline: `solveIncompressible`, `_solveDivergenceFreeImpl` and
`_solveDivergenceFreeOptimal`. They did not spell the same one --
`solveIncompressible` compared a *floored one-sided average* of the residual
against `tolerance` while both divergence-free loops compared a *mean absolute*
one -- and neither form was reachable from the config, so nothing could be
measured against anything. `JacobiConvergenceCriterion` names the three forms
and `evaluateResidual` computes them, so the two historical behaviours are
now two values of one setting rather than two pieces of code.

The forms, with `r = b - A p` restricted to fluid rows:

- ``flooredOneSided``: ``mean(clamp(-r, min=-tolerance))``.
  `solveIncompressible`'s historical test. One-sided (only over-compression
  counts) *and* floored: an under-dense particle contributes at most
  `-tolerance` instead of its full negative value, so it cannot cancel an
  over-dense one. Both published criteria are one-sided on the plain average
  ([BK] Alg. 3 `rho_avg - rho0 > eta`, [I] §5.1) and neither floors.
- ``oneSided``: ``mean(-r)``. The published form.
- ``meanAbsolute``: ``mean(|r|)``. Both divergence-free loops' historical test,
  and the only one of the three that is a norm.

`rtol`/`atol` add a *relative* disjunct on top, the same contract the Krylov
path already states: stop when ``mean|r| <= atol + rtol * mean|b|``. It is a
disjunction, not a replacement -- either test satisfied ends the solve --
because the absolute test is the one the papers state and the relative one is
the one that stays meaningful when the source carries a component the operator
cannot remove (`DFSPH_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` §1.1, §1.7). `rtol = 0` disables it.

See `DFSPH_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` §1.7 and Part 15.
